# My COMP6441 Assignment Submission for 2025
This is my best attempt with the short time that I had.
I was working on a bunch of stuff before this and had to get this up and running quickly. I had some of the code and boilerplate done before this code was uploaded.
So there will be a disconnect.

The webpage and stuff has been produced, but I prefer to run it using npm run dev to make life easier...

Music and stuff can be changed by changing out the file. I just chose something random for now but I am sure there is a lot more I could have done.

#to run the site
1. first do `npm i`
2. Then run `npm run dev` 

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
